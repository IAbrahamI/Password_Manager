## Creating Executable with auto-py-to-exe

If you prefer to create an executable file using `auto-py-to-exe`, follow these steps:

1. . Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. Install `auto-py-to-exe` (see requirements file to check the tested version):

    ```bash
    pip install auto-py-to-exe
    ```

4. Launch `auto-py-to-exe`:

    ```bash
    auto-py-to-exe
    ```

5. Follow the prompts in the graphical user interface to configure your executable. 

- Make sure to click on "**Select Script**" and navigate to the `App.py` file in your project directory. This is the entry point for your password manager application.

-   Under "**Additional Files**," make sure to click on the "**Add Folder**" and include the packages `Scripts` and `_internal`

-   Optionally, you can configure the "**Icon**". There is a .ico file in the repository which was created for it. If no icon is specified, the executable will be saved with the default python executable file icon.
  
-   Optionally, you can configure the "**Output Directory**" to specify where the generated executable file will be saved. If no output directory is specified, the executable will be saved in the default location.
    
-   Once you've configured the settings to your preference, click on "Convert .py to .exe" to generate the executable file.

6. Click on "Convert .py to .exe" to generate the executable file.

7. Once the conversion is complete, you'll find the executable file in the specified output directory.
